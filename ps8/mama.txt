Paradox 
Sound only exists 
as it’s going out of existence, 
someone wrote. 
These words you see 
now, as yet, 
have sound only 
in potential. 
Even the stars I summon 
here, with four simple letters, 
five marks on a screen
or piece of paper,
have only your imagination 
and mine 
to give them light,
meaning. 
The light in the stars 
we see in the sky 
is vanished, source 
extinguished. 
We are seeing 
afterthoughts, energy 
that has flowed. 
But is it not real?
What are we the receivers of 
Exactly? Billions and trillions 
of bits and bytes, data 
and dates, emojis 
and emotions, tunes 
and tunnels of sound 
and information flowing 
through the ethers and 
through me 
as I put thumb to device, 
flowing through you
as you read… 
So much is happening! 
Unceasing expansion,
incessant life!
Extinguished sound,
Extinct light 
like soil, like clay to be molded,
smashed, and re-formed.
Electrical impulses I can’t explain 
moving my thumb 
to help me express 
this astounding ability 
to focus at all 
within the innumerable 
moving parts 
of an ecstatic creation 
constantly recreating itself.
I lean against an oak, 
soften myself against its 
sturdiness, settle into the soles 
of my platform heeled 
burgandy brown Doc Martins, 
breathe deeply 
of air that’s been exhaled 
countless times… 
And still I am refreshed,
inspired by defunct stars,
flowing words that have 
been expressed ad infinitum. 
Bits and bytes, data 
streaming forward for the sheer joy 
of endless expression 
into the infinite 
cycling and recycling 
of creation.
