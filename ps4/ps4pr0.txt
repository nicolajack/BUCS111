PS 4: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.


Kurzweil’s vision of the future is one that I do not look forward to because I feel as though society is already too heavily reliant on technology, and I fear that a future in which computers wield more power than humans will greatly harm humanity. In particular, I fear for the arts as AI gets more advanced; I am of the opinion that ‘art’ made by AI is not actually art as it fails to harbor the same emotional meaning present within artwork made by humans. I do believe the predictions cited in this article because Kurzweil seems to be incredibly knowledgeable within his field and it feels as though humanity is already trending in this direction. However, I am a bit skeptical of Kurzweil in general as the way he is described in the article paints him as slightly insane.
